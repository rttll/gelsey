    “astonishing vocal versatility […] Bell often subsumes the evening’s mystery
    within a spectral shape-shifting, as if she contained young and old, male
    and female, living and dead within her frame at the same time — just as her
    flexible voice is equally at home in the folk, bebop, atonal or experimental
    elements”<br />

    Gelsey Bell “squints her eyes, opens her mouth as wide as a Francis Bacon
    cardinal and lets out a virtuosic, slowly mounting sound that is part rasp,
    part scream, part nails dragging down a chalkboard. It’s a glorious noise,
    especially because it seems to come upon Ms. Bell unaware, inserting itself
    like an unruly guest into a voice that is otherwise sweet and folksy. But
    that’s the point: You hear the screech, and you think harder about the
    smoothly sweet parts than you otherwise might.”<br />
